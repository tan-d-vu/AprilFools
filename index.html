              Guided outdoor adventure sports are a $12.9B industry in the US, but the world still lacks a comprehensive,
              trustworthy marketplace for guides to connect with clients online. Adventurelist seeks to solve that problem 
              by creating a single place where the adventurously-minded can connect with qualified, certified experts who will 
              lead them on their next great expedition.

            </p>
            <p>
              We strive to connect outdoor adventurers of all skill levels
              and abilities with exciting, meaningful outdoor experiences.

<!--
Combining the two landing page sites:
Add in the sponsors to the landing page DONE
No need to add in images/graphics for "Our Values," add in "Our Values to landing site" DONE

About Us can be about "Who are we" and the team/background, how Adventurelist started 

"Our Adventures" - current landing site, feel like only photos are clickable and should take you somewhere; better to include text describing the photos instead


Sharetribe site:
Add in category of different areas (Northeast, West, Rockies etc.) so people can filter
Contacting guides: sharetribe has limited functionalities, maybe direct contact to guides (email/text/call)
