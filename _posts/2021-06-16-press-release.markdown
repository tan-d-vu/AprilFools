                    “When I was on active duty, my friends and I always looked for adventure during our limited free
                    time.
                    We often grew frustrated with how hard it was to find guides and instructors without a ton of extra
                    homework,” says CEO and founder, Jeff Phaneuf, who conceived of Adventurelist while serving in the
                    US
                    Marines. “Our mission is to make it easier for people to find guides and instructors so they can
                    learn
                    new skills, experience the outdoors, and adventure into the wild safely.”
